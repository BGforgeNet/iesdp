This file defines constitution influence on the creature.<br />
First column is the value of NPCs constitution.<br />
2nd column is the HP bonus for all classes except warriors.<br />
3rd column the same as above, but for warriors.<br />
4th column refers to the minimum possible roll for Hit Points before the bonus is applied. Normal and Easy difficulties ignore this Min_Roll column as they grant the maximum possible roll for the class involved, plus any bonus.<br />
In other words, if I'm a human fighter with an 18 CON, I can roll any value from 1 (Min_Roll) to 10 and then add my bonus. With Easy and Normal difficulties, the fighter would always roll a 10 + bonus, ignoring the Min_Roll value.<br />
5th fatigue bonus for constitution.<br />
6th column as the name states, the rate of regeneration modifier for the Nameless One.<br />
7th column defines the Hit Points granted for the first level.<br />
<br />
In PSTEE we have:<br />
