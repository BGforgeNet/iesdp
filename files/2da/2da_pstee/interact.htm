This file defines the interaction comments between NPCs. The interaction comments themselves are strrefs stored in the <a href="../../../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">CRE</a> file (offset 0xa4), and are grouped into interaction types as per <a href="../../ids/pstee/soundoff.htm">SOUNDOFF.IDS</a>/<a href="../../ids/pstee/sndslot.htm">SNDSLOT.IDS</a>. The engine randomly selects which specific comment to make out of the apportioned range (e.g. INSULT_1 or INSULT_2 etc.). Some interaction types have a response, selected from the response group of the target CRE, if the relevant row/column crossing is set in this file.<br />
First column and row are filled with NPC death variables, while the column/row intersections are marked by the letters indicating which interaction should take place in the interaction circumstance; the list of interaction types is below along with the sound range from soundoff.ids/sndslot.ids:<br /><br />
