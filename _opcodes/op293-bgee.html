The targeted creature(s) will still run scripts when off-screen and out of combat.
<br/>
<br/>The effect modifies <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#183">PREVENT_AI_SLOWDOWN</a> to <code>Stat Value</code>.

{% capture note %}
Creatures in EE run scripts as long as they are in the current area, <a href="#op293">opcode #293</a> does not alter this, nor allow their scripts to run while they are in different areas.
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html %}

{% capture note %}
The <code>Stat Value</code> parameter can take any value. If you set it to <code>0</code>, you will disable the effect (for its duration).
