Set the Dice Throws and Size to the random drain ammount you wish the effect to do (if you want no random ammount involved, leave it at 0d0).  If you wish to do a fixed ammount of draining as well, or by itself, set the Fixed Drain parameter to the ammount of health to drain (if you want no fixed ammount of HP drained, leave the value at 0). The Drain Type sets who receives and who delivers the hit points.
<br/>Known values for 'Drain Type' are:
<br/>0   the target receives hit points
<br/>1   the caster receives hit points
<br/>2   the target and caster hit points (this works even if both are at full health)
<br/>3   the target receives hit points (this works even if both are at full health. No damage animation is shown)
