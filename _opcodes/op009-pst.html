Set the RGB Colour parameter to the colour value you want to use with the second byte being the Red portion (0-255), the third byte the Green portion (0-255), and the fourth byte being the Blue portion (0-255) and the part specified by the third byte of the Speed parameter determining the speed of the flashing with 01 the fastest and 255 the slowest. A speed parameter of 0 does not pulsate.  If the colour values are all set to 0, the glow effect only occurs if the creature is in darkness; outside at night, inside a building, or standing in shadows.
