Applies the modifier value specified by the 'Statistic Modifier' field in the style specified by the 'Type' field.
<br/>THAC0, saving throws, turn undead level and thief skills are not affected. Spell slots and selection are not affected (though casting level is). Single/dual class characters gain 2 HP/level, multi-class characters gain 1 HP/level. Warriors gain an extra 1/2 attack at levels 7 and 13. Gaining any XP while at the altered level makes the level change permanent.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<br/>0   Cumulative Modifier -> Level = Level + 'Statistic Modifier' value
<br/>1   Flat Value Modifier -> Level = 'Statistic Modifier' value
<br/>2   Percentage Modifier -> Level = (Level * 'Statistic Modifier' value) / 100
