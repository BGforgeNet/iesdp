Displays the text specified by the 'Strref' field, in the style specified by the 'Type' field.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<ul>
	<li>0 => Default (show strref)</li>
	<li>1 => Cynicism (show Cynicism strrefs)</li>
</ul>

About Cynicism option:
<ul>
	<li>Uses a random String Reference from between 24916 â€“ 24940.</li>
	<li>Triggers at random intervals throughout its duration.</li>
	<li>Maintains <a href="../files/ids/bgee/splstate.htm">SPLSTATE</a>[255|CYNICISM_EQUIPPED] on the targeted creature(s).</li>
</ul>


If used from an external effect (.eff), 'Strref' is set to 0 and 'Type' to 1, the third parameter will
dictate the first strref and 'Special' will dictate the count. Then the number of lines of 'Special' will
be displayed starting with the strref in 'Starting strref'.
