Applies the blindness effect to the targeted creature(s). This sets <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#147">VISUALRANGE</a> to 2, sets <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT18">STATE_BLIND</a> to true and incurs a cummulative 10 point base THAC0 penalty (4 on EE games, plus a cumulative 4 point base AC penalty. All of that is unverified in PST).
Maintains its own portrait icon <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/statdesc.htm">(#8|"Blind")</a>.

{% capture note %}
Timing modes 1/4/7 will permanently set the creature's <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT18">STATE_BLIND</a> flag, leaving no removable effect.
