The Modifier Type parameter sets how the Statistic Modifier works. If it it a 00 then it makes the Modifier a flat point modifier (i.e. statistic plus the modifier number), if it is 01 the Modifier is a straight stat change (i.e. the statistic becomes what ever value the Modifier is), and if it is a 02 then the Modifier is a percentile modifier (i.e. the ability is multiplied by the Modifier value in percent so 10 is 10% making the ability 10% of its value).
