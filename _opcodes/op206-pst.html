The embalming type parameter determines what affect is given to the target of the effect. 
<br/>A 0 will give the target 2-8 hit points and +1 AC for the duration of the spell. 
<br/>Any other value gives the target +2 hit points per level of the caster and +2 AC. 
<br/>Both effects last for the duration of the spell.
