Instantly kills the targeted creature(s), if the targeted creature(s) has less than 60 HP.<br/>
More specifically, it functions by applying <a href="#op13">opcode #13</a> (<code>Death Type = 4 // Normal Death</code>).

{% capture note %}
<a href="#op101">Immunity</a> to <a href="#op13">opcode #13</a> is not sufficient to block this effect unless it's granted through <code><a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/7eyes.htm">7EYES.2DA</a></code>.
