Each <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">CRE</a> files has a Creature Power Level number (at 0x18). This effect summons a number of monsters depending on this value, the special parameter and if it is used in <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/spl_v1.htm">SPL</a> / <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/itm_v1.htm">ITM</a> or from an external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a>.<br>
<br/>When used in SPL/ITM, known value for 'Mode' are:
<ul>
	<li>0 => Summon amount equal to ('Count' + Dice rolls)</li>
	<li>1 => Summon amount equal to ('Count' + Dice rolls)</li>
	<li>2 => Summon until Creature Power Level equals/exceeds "Caster Level"</li>
</ul>

<br/>When used in <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> known value for 'Mode' are:
<ul>
	<li>0 => Summon until Creature Power Level equals/exceeds 'Count'</li>
	<li>1 => Summon amount equal to ('Count' + Dice rolls)</li>
	<li>2 => Summon until Creature Power Level equals/exceeds "Caster Level" field of <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> (located at offset 0xc8)</li>
</ul>

<br/>The 'Type' field sets which <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/2da.htm">2DA</a> file to pick the creatures to summon from. The 2da files are listed in <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/smtables.htm">SMTABLES.2DA</a>.
<br/>If the resource field is filled, it will use a custom .2da to determine which monsters to summon.
<br/>If used from an external effect (.eff), the vvc field controls the bam/vvc file played over the creatures when summoning.
<br/>If used from an external effect (.eff), the second vvc field controls the bam file played over the target area when summoning.<br>

{% capture note %}
As far as the <a href="../files/ids/bgee/ea.htm">allegiance</a> of the summoned creatures
is concerned, this opcode uses "Match Target", which sets the summoned creature's
allegiance to one of 4 (Ally), 128 (Neutral), or 255 (Enemy), based on the
summoner (whichever group the summoner belongs to).
