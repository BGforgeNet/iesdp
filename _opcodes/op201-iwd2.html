*DONT USE*
<br/>The targeted creature(s) will absorb a number of spells (specified by the 'Amount' field), from the spell level specified in the 'Level' field. A spell is assigned to a spell level by the power level of the first effect greater than the 'Level' parameter in the extended header that is being called.
