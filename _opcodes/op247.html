Applies the attack nearest creature effect on the targeted creature(s).
<br/>This effect causes the targeted creature(s) to attack the nearest creature. The affected creature becomes berserk and its AI scripts stop running. Grants a <code>+2</code> bonus to hit and damage with all weapons. Unlike <a href="op3">opcode #3</a>, this one can affect enemies as well.
<br/>
<br/>This effect sets <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#144">BERSERKSTAGE2</a> to <code>Constant Value</code>. It also sets the <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT1">STATE_BERSERK</a> flag.

{% capture note %}
The <code>Constant Value</code> parameter should be non-zero.

{% capture note %}
At least in EEs, the only difference between opcodes <a href="#op3">#3</a> and <a href="#op247">#247</a>, is that <a href="#op247">opcode #247</a> will not force the creature(s) to use melee weapons, and is not removed by <a href="#op4">opcode #4</a> (Cure Berserk).
