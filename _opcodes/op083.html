<a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/pro_v1.htm#0x8_3">Area-Effect</a> projectiles only impact through their <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/pro_v1.htm#0x21A">explosion</a> and/or <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/pro_v1.htm#0x214">secondary</a> projectiles, so they are what must be specified in <code>Projectile Index</code>.

{% capture note %}
Cannot protect against the projectile used by Melee weapon attacks (this is contrast to <a href="#op197">opcode #197</a>, which CAN reflect them (by specifying projectile <code>#0|NONE</code>)).
