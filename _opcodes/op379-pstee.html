This effect causes a penalty to all saving throws and To Hit rolls in the amount that the <code>Value</code> parameter is set to. For every 1 of the penalty value, all saving throws get a penalty of 1, as well as all die throws and damage from the target. This cannot remove the 'Blessed' status from a target, but can effectively negate it.
