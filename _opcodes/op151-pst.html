Leave both parameters at all zeros for this Effect to work. The Resource Key must be set to the Creature Name (i.e. the .cre file name) to be summoned.
<br/>If cast upon a party member, the summoned creature appears in the same spot as the target, and the target is moved over slightly.
<br/>If cast upon a non party member, the summoned creature appears in the same spot as the target, and the target is removed totally.
<br/>Timing modes 'Duration' and 'Delay with Duration' (Timing mode 3) both function as 'Permantent' and 'Delayed', accordingly.
