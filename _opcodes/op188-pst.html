Plays BAM file along with other special features.
<br/>Known bit values of Method are:
<br/>0x1000   - Sticky flag (default is opposite as with #187)
<br/>0x30000  - Both bits must be set, this causes Repeat animation
<br/>0x100000 - RGB is used as transparency, fade totally at speed of DiceSize
<br/>There are four effects doing exactly the same, this is probably to have resistances against opcode.
<br/>#188 used for swarm curse
<br/>#189 used mostly for Ravel's spells (black barbed curse, vampiric touch, blacksphere, cone of cold and stygian ice.)
<br/>#190 appears to be unused
<br/>#191 used for the rest of the spells.
