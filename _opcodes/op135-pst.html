This effect will polymorph the target into the creature type (i.e. the .cre file name) set by the Resource Key. The Change Specifics parameter sets information about how the polymorph affects the target. The known values for the Change Specifics parameter are 1 for polymorph with creature colouring, spellcasting enabled, and gain none of creature statistics or resistences; and 2 for polymorph with creature statistics only.
