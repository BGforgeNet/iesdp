Removes effects from the resource specified by the resouce key, in the style specified by the 'Type' field. Both spell and item resources are considered.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<br/>0   Default
<br/>1   Equipped effects list only
<br/>2   Timed effects list only
<br/>

{% capture note %}
It always needs to be the first effect for stacking prevention. Timing Mode should be either Instant/Limited(0) with 0 duration, or Instant/Permanent(1).
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html %}

{% capture note %}
Leaving the resource field empty will remove any effect on the creature without a parent resource. Weapon proficiencies, HLA markers, stealth, turn undead (paladin's panic only) ...  Local variable effects are however safe.
{% endcapture %}
