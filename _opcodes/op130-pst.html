The Statistic Modifier parameter sets what point modifier this Effect has on Saving Throws, Damage, and Die Rolls.  For every 1 of the Static modifier, a +1 bonus is given to all saving throws, damage, and all die rolls of the target.  Can not remove the 'Cursed' status, but can effectively negate it.
