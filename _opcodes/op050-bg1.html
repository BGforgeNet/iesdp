The targeted creature(s) entire animation glows the colour specified by the 'RGB Colour' field, at the speed specified by the (3rd byte of the) 'Speed' field.
<br/>The 'RGB Colour' field is handled as follows:
<br/>Second byte = Red (0-255)
<br/>Third byte  = Green (0-255)
<br/>Fourth byte = Blue (0-255)
<br/>The 'Speed' field is handled as follows:
<br/>Third byte  = Speed (0-255)
<br/>A speed of 0 does not pulsate. A speed of 1 is fastest, and a speed of 255 is slowest.
