Set the RGB Colour parameter to the colour value you want to use with the second byte being the Red portion (0-255), the third byte the Green portion (0-255), and the fourth byte being the Blue portion (0-255).  The third byte of the Timing parameter determines how long the effect takes to reach fully colourization, outside of duration, after which it immediately ends.  Valid values are 1-200 for this parameter, with 1 being the fastest.
