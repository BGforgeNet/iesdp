If present on a creature's effect list, this opcode enables extra logic when the creature is checking its saving throws against an effect.

<div style="margin-top: 0.5em">In particular &ndash; if an incoming effect:</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        Does <b>not</b> have any of the lower 5 bits of its <a href="{{ '/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm#effv2_Body_0x40' | prepend: relurl }}"><code>Saving throw type</code></a> set
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>and</b> <code>BIT2</code> of its <a href="{{ '/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm#effv2_Body_0x5C' | prepend: relurl }}"><code>Dispel/Resistance</code></a> field is set
    </li>
</ul>

&rightarrow; then the presence of this opcode causes the incoming effect's <a href="{{ '/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm#effv2_Body_0x40' | prepend: relurl }}"><code>Saving throw type</code></a>
to be shifted 5 bits to the right. The usual saving throw logic is subsequently applied to the shifted
<a href="{{ '/file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm#effv2_Body_0x40' | prepend: relurl }}"><code>Saving throw type</code></a> contents.
