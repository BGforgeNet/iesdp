Applies the imprisonment effect to the targeted creature(s).
<br/>The field at <code>0xcc</code> can be used to prevent death related effects (e.g. removal from party) running on the targetted creature(s) – not verified on EE games (it is very likely that this was replaced by giving <a href="#op213">Maze</a> a specified <code>duration</code> option).
<br/><br/>

Aside from kicking from the party, or granting experience for a kill, the targeted creature(s) is suspended from the area:
<ul>
	<li>They can not be targeted by <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/pro_v1.htm#0x8_3">Area-Effect</a> projectiles, only with effect targets <code>Party</code> or <code>Everyone</code> or similar.</li>
	<li>They are not detectable by any script triggers, though they may still be targeted with actions directly by scriptname or partyslot.</li>
	<li>
		Excluding Opcodes <a href="#op211">#211</a>/<a href="#op212">#212</a>/<a href="#op213">#213</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>All other effects on the creature are suppressed until this effect is removed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Excluding <a href="#op212">opcode #212</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>Delayed effects that would trigger will be further delayed until this effect is removed.</li>
			<li>Effects that would expire will not expire until this effect is removed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
