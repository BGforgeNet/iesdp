Set the 'Amount' parameter as the amount of damage, and the Disease Type parameter as how the disease functions.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; Inflict 1 HP per second ('Frequency Multiplier' is ignored â€“ 'Amount' needs to be non-zero)</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Inflict 1 HP per second (for best results, leave 'Frequency Multiplier' at zero, 'Amount' between 1 and 101)</li>
	<li>2 &longrightarrow; Deal 'Amount' damage every 'Frequency Multiplier' second(s)</li>
	<li>3 &longrightarrow; Deal one damage every 'Amount' * 'Frequency Multiplier' second(s)</li>
	<li>4 &longrightarrow; Reduce Strength score by 'Amount'</li>
	<li>5 &longrightarrow; Reduce Dexterity score by 'Amount'</li>
	<li>6 &longrightarrow; Reduce Constitution score by 'Amount'</li>
	<li>7 &longrightarrow; Reduce Intelligence score by 'Amount'</li>
	<li>8 &longrightarrow; Reduce Wisdom score by 'Amount'</li>
	<li>9 &longrightarrow; Reduce Charisma score by 'Amount'</li>
	<li>10 &longrightarrow; Slow Effect</li>
	<li>11 &longrightarrow; Mold touch/Single</li>
	<li>12 &longrightarrow; Mold touch/Decrement</li>
	<li>13 &longrightarrow; Contagion</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>'Amount' can be positive (penalty) or negative (bonus).
<br/><br/>
'Icon' defines the index from <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/statdesc.htm">STATDESC.2DA</a> for custom portrait icons. Default value is none (no icon).

Permanent timing modes require a duration for this effect to work.

{% capture note %}
This opcode deals "Poison" damage, except Mold Touches, which deal "Magic" damage.
{% endcapture %}

{% include info.html %}

{% capture note %}
If 'Frequency Multiplier' = 0, its value is treated as 1. This is the default value for SPL/ITM effects.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture note %}
The Slow effect is no different from that caused by <a href="#op40">opcode #40</a> (Slow), including its stacking interaction with Haste, except that it is blocked/removed as a disease, not as a slow effect.
{% endcapture %}

{% include info.html %}

{% capture note %}
Contagion is a composite of Strength, Dexterity, Charisma drain and the Slow effect, each ability score reduced by 'Amount'.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture note %}
When the 'Type' field is 1:
<ul>
	<li>if the 'Frequency Multiplier' field is non-zero, damage is always dealt.</li>
	<li>if the 'Amount' field is less than 256, damage is dealt while HP > 100 / 'Amount'.</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
Mold touch is complicated: the general idea is that it deals x or xd6 damage and applies the SPL file specified by the resource key (default: "original resource" + B) every (round or second) for either 1 round (single) or across multiple rounds dealing less each round (decrement).
In particular:
<ul>
	<li>If 'Type'=11:
		<ul>
			<li>Timing Mode should be 3 (with no duration).</li>
			<li>In <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/spl_v1.htm">SPL</a>s/<a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/itm_v1.htm">ITM</a>s, it always causes 1d6 damage.</li>
			<li>In external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a>s it functions identically to 'Mold Touch/Decrement', in every way (see below for further details).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>if 'Type'=12:
		<ul>
			<li>
				The first hit doesn't occur immediately, but instead at 80 ticks (exactly), the second hit occurs at 90 ticks (6 seconds), then later hits occur 1 round apart. So:<br />
				1st hit: 5.33s(80t), 2nd hit: 6s(90t), 3rd hit: 12s(180t), etc...<br />
				Oddly, this effect measures rounds as 6 seconds (90 ticks) intervals, not 100 ticks.
			</li>
			<li>
				As far as damage dealt is concerned, in <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/spl_v1.htm">SPL</a>s/<a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/itm_v1.htm">ITM</a>s:
				<ul>
					<li><code>x = 'Amount'(d6)</code>, decrementing the amount by 1 die every round, until zero.</li>
					<li>Should always use Timing Mode 1, 3 or 4, and only a non-zero duration if using Timing Mode 4.</li>
					<li>If Timing Mode is 1 or 4, the portrait icon, and <a href="../files/ids/bgee/splstate.htm">SPLSTATE DISEASED</a> remain until cured/death.</li>
					<li>If Timing Mode is 3 (with no duration), it will expire 1 round after the final damage (when it realizes the amount has reached zero). Timing Mode 3 and <code>duration = 0</code> should be the "default" setting for this mode right now.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				As far as damage dealt is concerned, in external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a>s:
				<ul>
					<li><code>x = (remaining Duration / 6)(d6)</code>, or just <code>(remaining Duration / 6)</code> if 'Frequency Multiplier' >= 65536.</li>
					<li>The damage dice is rounded down.</li>
					<li>Because the first hit doesn't occur until 80 ticks, any duration shorter will have no triggers.</li>
					<li>The Portrait Icon and <a href="../files/ids/bgee/splstate.htm">SPLSTATE DISEASED</a> will remain for the full specified duration.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The SPL resource is applied at the same/every time as the damage, though the damage occurs first.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
'Frequency Multiplier' determines whether it deals damage every second or every round, and whether it deals x or xd6 damage.
<ul>
	<li>'Frequency Multiplier' = 0 &longrightarrow; xd6 per round</li>
	<li>'Frequency Multiplier' = 65536 or greater (must be even) &longrightarrow; x per second</li>
	<li>'Frequency Multiplier' = 65537 or greater (must be odd) &longrightarrow; x per round</li>
</ul>
Regardless, the value of x decrements only once per round.
