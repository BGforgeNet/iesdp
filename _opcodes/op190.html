Alters the weapon's attack speed by the value specified by the 'Speed Modifier' field. This effect is not cumulative. Attack speed ranges from 0 (good) to 10 (bad). This effect acts as a bonus, so a high 'Speed Modifier' is good.
<br/>This effect sets <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#78">PHYSICALSPEED</a> to param #1.
