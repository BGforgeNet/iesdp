Casts a secondary spell (default: "original resource" + B) on the target, for a number of strikes specified by the 'Number' field. The spell will be cast once per 'Delay' through its projectile.
<br/>If a spell 'Level' is not specified, then the spell will be cast at level 1 and the damage opcodes will inherit the dice values of this effect, otherwise the spell will be cast at the given level.
<br/>'Delay' specifies the delay between hits, its default value is 6 (one round).

{% capture note %}
Its Saving Throw is checked EVERY time it triggers, terminating the <a href="#op333">op333</a> effect if successful, so unless that is desired (or it only triggers once), it should not have a Saving Throw.<br/>
See <a href="#op326">opcode #326</a> for some peculiarities of projectile behaviour.
