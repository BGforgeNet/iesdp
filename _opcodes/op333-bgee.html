Casts a secondary spell (default: original resource+B) on the target, for a number of strikes specified by the 'Number' field. The spell will be cast once per 'Special' through its projectile.
<br/>If a spell 'Level' is not specified, then the spell will be cast at level 1 and the damage opcodes will inherit the dice values of this effect, otherwise the spell will be cast at the given level.
<br/>'Delay' specifies the delay between hits, its default value is 6 (one round).
