Applies <a href="#op39">opcode #39</a> using <code>Sleep (Wake on Hit)</code> mode to the targeted creature(s), if the targeted creature(s) has less than 20 HP. The effect always lasts 5 rounds, and ignores the <code>duration</code> field. When calling the sleep opcode, parameters 2 and special are copied over.
