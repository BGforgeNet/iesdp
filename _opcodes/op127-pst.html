Summons a number of monsters.
<br/>Each creature files has a Creature Power Level number (at 0x18). The amount of monsters summoned by this effect is equal to the 'Number' field / Creature Power Level.
<br/>The 'Type' field set which 2da file to pick the creatures to summon from. The 2da files are monsumX and anisumX, where X = Type + 1. The .2da files must be edited to add valid creature names. A file named SPBOOM.bam is required in the override directory for this effect to work. The specific 2da files used are:
<br/>0 MONSUM01 Monster Summon 1
<br/>1 MONSUM02 Monster Summon 2
<br/>2 MONSUM03 Monster Summon 3
<br/>3 ANISUM01 Animal Summon 1
<br/>4 ANISUM02 Animal Summon 2
<br/>5 MONSUM01 Monster Summon 1 Hostile
<br/>6 MONSUM02 Monster Summon 2 Hostile
<br/>7 MONSUM03 Monster Summon 3 Hostile
<br/>8 ANISUM01 Animal Summon 1 Hostile
<br/>9 ANISUM02 Animal Summon 2 Hostile
<br/>A custom .2da file can be entered in the resource field.
<br/>If used from an external effect (.eff), the vvc field controls the bam file played when summoning.
