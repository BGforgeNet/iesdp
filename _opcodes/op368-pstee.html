Applied internally by <a href="#op375">opcode 375</a> to control duration of the specified BAM. When the effect ends, the attached BAM is removed and a hardcoded BAM (<code>S034DSPR.BAM</code>) is played back once to simulate an expiration effect.

<br/>Known values for <code>Flags</code> are:
<ul>
  <li>BIT6 &longrightarrow; Blended</li>
</ul>
