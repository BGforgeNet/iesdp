Applies the modifier value specified by the 'Statistic Modifier' field in the style specified by the 'Type' field.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; Cumulative Modifier: Strength = Strength + 'Statistic Modifier' value</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Flat Value Modifier: Strength = 'Statistic Modifier' value</li>
	<li>2 &longrightarrow; Percentage Modifier: Strength = (Strength * 'Statistic Modifier' value) / 100</li>
	<li>3 &longrightarrow; Bull's Strength (EE only)</li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>'Statistic Modifier' can be positive or negative.

{% capture note %}
All games but EEs:
<ul>
	<li>With a Timing Modes of Permanent or Delayed, if 'Type' is 0 and 'Statistic Modifier' is positive, the statistic will alter and remain shown in white text, and a message 'Strength raised permanently' will be shown.</li>
	<li>With a Timing Modes of Permanent or Delayed, if 'Type' is 1 or 2, or 'Statistic Modifier' is negative, the statistic will alter and remain shown in white text, though no message is shown.</li>
	<li>With all other Timing Modes, the statistic will alter and be shown in red text.</li>
</ul>
On EEs:
<ul>
	<li>There's no feedback message about stat being raised permanently in the EE's â€“ it must be done separately with <a href="#op139">opcode #139</a>.</li>
	<li>
		The opcode itself provides no coloring anymore (it's been externalized through "UI.menu")
		<ul>
			<li>An effective value &gt; base value &longrightarrow; <font color="green">green</font>.</li>
			<li>An effective value &lt; base value &longrightarrow; <font color="red">red</font>.</li>
			<li>An effective value &equals; base value &longrightarrow; white/default.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
When 'Type'=3:
<ul>
	<li>'Statistic Modifier' is unused: it uses the value listed in <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/clssplab.htm">CLSSPLAB.2da</a> for the creature's base class, or defaults to '1' if the file isn't present (it only exists by default in IWDEE).</li>
	<li>
		A single instance of this opcode (using 'Type'=3) cannot raise Strength above 18 (hardcoded), but multiple instances of it can.
		<ul>
			<li>
				This is because it only checks the limit against the creature's base score, not its effective score.
				<ul>
					<li>A Cleric with 12 base STR could gain up to +6 from the effect each time. Two max roll effects would take them to 24 STR.</li>
					<li>A Cleric with 16 base STR could only gain up to +2 from the effect each time.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Warrior classes also gain a &percnt; Strength score, their maximum is actually 18/100. Every '/10' is counted as +1 from their die roll. Warriors will not exceed 18/100 though, as once they hit 18, the remaining dice roll converts to a &percnt; increase, preventing their score from exceeding 18/100 (18/100 + /10 doesn't convert to 19).<br/>
				For instance, if a PALADIN with 17 STR rolls, say, 5, he will end up with 18/40 STR.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Like the other modes, applying the effect with Timing Mode 1 will affect the creature's base stat, leaving no removable effect.</li>
	<li>Once applied to a creature, 'Statistic Modifier' will store the exact STR increase granted, while the 'Special' field will store any Exceptional STR increase granted (only useful for lookup/editing through EEkeeper/NI).</li>
	<li>
		When you apply this effect in an External <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a>, (via <a href="#op177">op177</a> / <a href="#op283">op283</a>):
		<ul>
			<li>'Parameter1' in the EFF will determine the exact Strength increase (so it must be set manually, and ignores any limit).</li>
			<li>
				If 'Parameter1' is non-zero, Exceptional STR will still be rolled as normal (and only for appropriate Classes).
				<ul>
					<li>It will be equal to <code>10 * (Roll - (18 - Base))</code>, capped (0,100).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If 'Parameter1' is zero, no Exceptional STR will be granted.</li>
			<li>The actual increase for Exceptional STR will be stored in the 'Special' field of <a href="#op177">op177</a> / <a href="#op283">op283</a> (after it's been applied to the creature).</li>
			<li>Basically, it works exactly like 'Type'=0, except that warriors will still gain a random Exceptional STR increase (of course it's only noticeable if their resulting STR is 18).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
