  Changes the base stat of the referenced creature. Not all stats are modifiable, even if they are in [stats.ids]({{ ids }}/stats.htm). Some are recalculated by the engine (like Lore). Some, like BG2 proficiencies, are stored as continuous effects and can only be modified by changing those effects (Stat: Proficiency Modifier). Values for Modifier are from [statmod.ids]({{ ids }}/statmod.htm).
