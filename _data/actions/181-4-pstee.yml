  This action causes the active creature to cast the specified spell at the target object with the specified caster level. The spell need not currently be memorised by the caster, and will not be interrupted while being cast. The spell is cast instantly (i.e. with a casting time of 0). The specified caster level must meet the level requirements of the spell. The action must be added to action.ids before it can be used. Effect of the 'State' parameter is unknown.
