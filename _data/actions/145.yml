  This action instructs the active <a href="../../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">creature</a> to attempt to pick the lock of the specified object. This action can be used for any creature (not just thieves) though success in picking the lock depends on points in the <code><a href="../../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm#CREV1_0_Header_0x67">Open Locks</a></code> skill.
