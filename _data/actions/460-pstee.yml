  This action instructs the active creature to return to their home location, using their running animation if available. The default home location for creatures is equal to their default position in the [actor](../../file_formats/ie_formats/are_v1.htm#formAREAV1_0_Actor) structure. It can be overridden by the [SavePlace()](#448) action.
