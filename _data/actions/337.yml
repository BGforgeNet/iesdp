  This action causes the active creature to cast the specified spell at the target point. The spell need not currently be memorised by the caster, and will not be interrupted while being cast. The spell is cast instantly (i.e. with a casting time of 0). The caster must meet the level requirements of the spell. For the RES version of the action, the spell name can not consist of only numbers, should be written in upper case and should be no more than 7 characters long.

  {% capture note %}
  Scripts can handle `RES` filenames with `+`, Dialogs and the console cannot. Same with the `~`, `` ` ``, `'`, `@`, `$`, `^`, and `&` characters, maybe some more.
  - This action will default to a spell matching the first 7 characters in Dialogs/Console *IF* the 8<sup>th</sup> character isn't valid.
