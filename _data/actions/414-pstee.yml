  This action generates data for the Modron Maze (AR13**). The generated data is stored as TORMENT.MAZE resource in the SAV file.
  {% capture note %} This action is currently bugged (as of v3.1.3). It causes game data in the SAV file to be overwritten with data from the override folder. This effectively resets any changes in the affected resources (areas, stores, etc.). As a workaround it is recommended to install the "Generalized Biffing" mod. {% endcapture %} {% include warning.html %}
